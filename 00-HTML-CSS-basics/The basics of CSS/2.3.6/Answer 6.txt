How could you add weight to the global font definition to win over the classes added by point 3?

- A way to give add weight to the global font definition is using the property "!important". As follows:

*{
 font-size: 20px !important;
}

.text{
 font-size: 10px;
}

If an element used the "text" class, the global declaration would have more weight
