        <h2>The Munchkin cat</h2>
        <p>
          The Munchkin cat or Sausage cat is a newer breed of cat characterized by its very short legs, which are caused by a genetic mutation. 
          The Munchkin is considered to be the original breed of dwarf cat. 
          Much controversy erupted over the breed when it was recognized by The International Cat Association (TICA) in 1995 with critics voicing concern over potential health and mobility issues. 
          Governing Council of the Cat Fancy has not recognized it as a standardised breed.
          <br><br>
          The name "munchkin" derives from writer L. Frank Baum's diminutive inhabitants of Munchkin Country, originating in the 1900 novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.
